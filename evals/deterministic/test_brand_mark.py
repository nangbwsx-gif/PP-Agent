"""The three copies of the Waku mark must stay one drawing.

The dashboard paints the mark through a CSS mask, so its colour comes from the
page and one file is enough. A README cannot do that — GitHub gives an <img>
no way to read the page theme — so the two inks ship as two more files, picked
by <picture>. Three files, one shape: that is a drift waiting to happen the
next time the bird is redrawn, and these tests are what catches it.
